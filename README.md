# solid-typescript-starter
Typescript starter for [Solid](https://github.com/ryansolid/solid) framework

This is a WIP progress repo for an easier Typescript start with Solid.

Uses webpack for bundling, Typescript for static typing, ESLint for linting the code and Prettier for automatic code formatting if VSCode is used.

* Installation

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

* Unit test

Jest (TS-Jest) and Testing Library (DOM part) are used for POC unit tests.

* To do
- Improve and maybe separate Webpack configuration builds for development and production
- Use better assets - atm, the logo is just cropped from the logo with name
